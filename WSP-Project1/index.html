			<h2>Full Screen Slider</h2>
			<img src="images/fullscreenslider.jpg" alt="Slider">
			<p id='learn'><span>What I hope to practice/learn:</span> A full screen image slider is a great way to catch the attention of someone who visits a page for the first time. It may require extra code to complete, but being a fan of the look, it's worth it to learn.</p>
			<p id='degree'><span>How this relates to my degree:</span> This is a very easy way to give the user an interactive experience while keeping the focus on the content. It will also give the client a memorable website. Both of which have been discussed in previous classes that I've had.</p>

			<h2>Image Gallery</h2>
			<img src="images/imagegallery.jpg" alt="Gallery">
			<p id="learn"><span>What I hope to practice/learn:</span> Image galleries seem to be pretty simple, but it's always something basic that can be most difficult to code. Galleries are essential for art porfolios or showcasing items for sale which pretty much makes it essential for me as a developer.</p>
			<p id="images/degree"><span>How this relates to my degree:</span> In the design aspect, it's very aesthetically pleasing to see a gallery or grid of images like the ones in this picture. It provides an easy and clear visual image for the user to be able to see everything in one area and is simple to make responsive.</p>
			<section id="list">
				<h3>Hypothesis on how to make this</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Create section as a seperate container</li>
						<li>Add each of the images to as an ul or seperate box</li>
						<li>Style the images to display inline</li>
						<li>Set styles to make a clean grid</li>
					</ol>

			<h2>Basic Form</h2>
			<img src="images/form.jpg" alt="form">
			<p id="learn"><span>What I hope to practice/learn:</span> One of the most difficult things for me as a developer so far has been forms. They are necessary on any website nowadays, whether it be for logging in, searching or signing up for a certain website. Creating and styling them to look modern will be a challenge for me, but it's necessary.</p>
			<p id="degree"><span>How this relates to my degree:</span> Forms are one of the most basic HTML compenents and it helps the user submit information to the back-end of the website to store and unlock other features. We've been learning about how to collect information from the user in my previous courses and a form is still the best way.</p>

			<h2>Double Background Images</h2>
			<img src="images/doubleimage.jpg" alt="double background">
			<p id="learn"><span>What I hope to practice/learn:</span> This seems to be a trend in the designing aspect of websites, as I've seen it on numerous different sites. Adding text over the images seems simple but it's always good to go back to the basics.</p>
			<p id="degree"><span>How this relates to my degree:</span> Design wise, this is a trend and to be up on the latest trends will be my job as a developer and designer. This is also an attention grabber and keeps the site interesting and from being too plain or bare. It's a very useful design technique that has been discussed in my past design classes.</p>

			<h2>Floating Paragraphs</h2>
			<img src="images/floatingparagraphs.jpg" alt="floating paragraphs">
			<p id="learn"><span>What I hope to practice/learn:</span> Floats are something that I've seen a lot of people struggle with, including myself, so I would like to work more on creating floats and keeping them neat and organized to improve the design.</p>
			<p id="degree"><span>How this relates to my degree:</span> I believe it was one of my first few courses into coding that started teaching about floats and it baffled me. It's simple to float something, but organizing them and keeping the site neat can be easily messed up as the floating ignores the other objects on the screen.</p>

			<h2>Rollover Images with Descriptions</h2>
			<img src="images/rollover.jpg" alt="Rollover">
			<p id="learn"><span>What I hope to practice/learn:</span> Animating the paragraphs to show up when the user hovers over the images in a grid will allow a lot of extra information to be stored neatly on a single page. It reduces the number of pages necessary to get the information to the user.</p>
			<p id="degree"><span>How this relates to my degree:</span> This design creates a very simple, user-oriented webpage and helps the users find information easily. User interaction is one thing that all developers and designer have to keep in mind and this design reinforces that.</p>
